# Behnams Server

This server has a simple API for Behnam to call when doing ML on faces. 

## Set Up

You will need:

* Java 8 JDK
* A newer web browser

Once you have cloned the code, cd into this directory.

Run:

```
gradlew.bat clean build bootrun
```

Once this executes (give it a few mins the first time as gradle and its dependancies need to be downloaded), you will be able to open a web brower @ the following address:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Choose the connect button:
